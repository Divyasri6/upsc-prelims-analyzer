# UPSC Prelims Exam Performance Analyzer

This project is a Flask-based backend application that analyzes UPSC Prelims exam responses using advanced AI-driven analysis with LangChain, LangGraph, and OpenAI's GPT models. The system evaluates student answers, infers cognitive mindset insights on incorrect responses, performs subject-wise performance breakdown, analyzes unattempted questions, and generates a comprehensive summary report with actionable study recommendations.

## Features
- **subject_tagging:** Generate subject name for each question
- **Automated Question Evaluation:** Classifies each answer as Correct, Wrong, or Unattempted.
- **Mindset Analysis:** Deep cognitive insights on why a student chose incorrect options, identifying misconceptions and knowledge gaps.
- **Subject Performance Breakdown:** Calculates accuracy and highlights strong and weak subjects.
- **Unattempted Question Analysis:** Explains potential reasons for skipping questions.
- **Comprehensive Summary Report:** Provides detailed feedback and an actionable plan for future exam preparation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
### Frontend (React.js + TailwindCSS)
- Upload exam JSON and send to backend
- Show streamed or generated report
- Uses Axios for API calls
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
### Backend (Flask + LangGraph + OpenAI)
- Python Flask app exposes /api/analyze_exam
- LangGraph orchestrates analysis steps:
- Planning
- Subject Inference (LLM or keyword-based)
- Evaluation
- Mindset Inference
- Subject Performance Analysis
- Unattempted Reasoning
- Summary Report
  
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask (Web API)
- LangChain, LangGraph (AI workflow orchestration)
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (Language model)
- Pydantic (Data validation)
- dotenv (Environment variable management)
- Flask-CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)
